## Short Description

This is my second Mobile App I built with Flutter and Dart. 
It's almost like the I am Rich App I created before but with an Gif anstead of the image and custom icons.

### Hint

I created this app by the guidance of Angely Yu's Flutter Bootcamp on Appbrewery.co.

To follow the module easily I watched the course and rebuilt step by step what was explained. 
Knowing the importance of implementing feature in branches I refused to use branches while I was creating the apps in this course. 



## What I learnt

- use gifs in the project
- modify your own icons
